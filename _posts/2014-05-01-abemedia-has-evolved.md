ABE Media has evolved over the last few years and turned from a simple **web design company** to a web application smithy, churning out highly complex **database applications**, **bespoke ecommerce systems** and **custom Joomla! extensions** so we felt our website no longer represented us and had to change.

Finally, after months of back and forth to capture the feel of the new ABE Media, we are please to announce the launch of our **brand new website**!

We'd love to hear your feedback on it so feel free to have a look around and [leave a comment](#disqus_thread) or [contact us](/contact) to let us know what you think.
